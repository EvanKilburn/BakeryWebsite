## Preface 
This website was developed as a part of CISC 282 over the term. This was a solo project and I am very happy with my final result. The code that I have uploaded has been approved by my Professor for CISC 282. I have removed the images from /img as I do not own the rights to them.

## About
The website has 3 pages with the first index.php being the landing page with a brief introduction and explanation of the website. Recpies.php containes a table of recipes with descriptions. The only active recipe with a step by step is the pizza dough recipe which links to pizza-dough.php. Pizza-dough.php contains a comment section at the bottom equipped with an HTML forum, JavaScript validation and PHP serverside commands. Additionally the step by step recipe can be adjusted to the amount of the recipe you wish to make via JavaScript and completed steps can be hidden via jQuery. This website makes use of media queries and was originally developed with a mobile first display, then later a tablet and desktop view were added.
